# Ora
Decentralized, Peer-to-Peer, Content Storage/Streaming Platform

## Sometimes, You Have To Think Small

With the recent explosion of technologies and applications implementing decentralized blockchain technology, I, like many others, wondered 
about the state of things to come. Anyone with a cursory understanding of this stuff can see the technological implications from a 
mile away, and many people have shall we say, _taken the initiative_ to say the least. Universal VMs, banking terminals, gambling, charity,
autonomous organizations, you name it. Yet, after all of this progress, people haven't really stopped to look at the small picture. 
In the service of pursuing lofty life-changing, "page in the history book" goals, no one as stopped to think about the basics. The 
blockchain can do old things better, and there's something commendable about breathing life into an old idea. Hence, Ora.

## What It Actually Is

Ora is a platform for storing, streaming, and sharing content. That's it, pretty much. I want to focus on making it really good at those 
two things, with community and cosmetic features coming along afterwards. As things progress, updates will become easier and more frequent. 

## Initial Technical Details

The platform will run on a series of ethereum contracts, will store content on IPFS, and will use BigchainDB as a database.
